> [!TIP]
> The version of neovim that can be obtained with `sudo apt-get install neovim` is outdated, and some configurations may not work properly. I recommend obtaining the latest version of neovim via AppImage by following the instructions at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#appimage-universal-linux-package.
